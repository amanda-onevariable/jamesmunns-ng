A quick note: I've added a section for "Native" Testing in my previous post regarding CI Testing Techniques for Embedded Systems. Its definitely an important technique that I should have mentioned from the start! Check it out [here](https://jamesmunns.com/update/2017/05/07/hardware-ci-overview.html), and let me know if there are any other techniques that I missed. Thanks to Ludwig Kn√ºpfer for bringing it to my attention.
