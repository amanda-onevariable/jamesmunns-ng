Hey all, just a quick note on whats going on in my life right now. I'm leaving my current position at Geeny/Telef√≥nica Next, and focusing on a personal project around Continuous Integration for Firmware and Hardware development for (at least) the next few months. This would help developers implement Hardware in the Loop testing as described by a [previous blog post](https://jamesmunns.com/blog/hardware-ci-overview/) of mine.

Oh, and hopefully I'll find some time to relax for a couple weeks.

<!-- more -->

I'll be sharing more about my project in the near future (when I have something more functional to share!). If this sounds like something interesting for you or your company, please send me an email at [james@onevariable.com](mailto:james@onevariable.com)!

There are also a few other technical interests I have, and would be excited to work in again. These include (in no particular order):

* Working in a Safety Critical industry, particularly Aviation or Aeronautics
* Developing Embedded Linux systems, particularly in Rust
* Developing Bare Metal/RTOS systems, particularly in Rust
* Some combination of the above items

I also am open to a limited amount of part-time consulting. If you need help with any of the following, please also get in touch:

* Systems design and engineering
* Working with Rust (for embedded or non-embedded projects)
* Developing or Testing embedded systems

When in doubt, shoot me an email! I would love to hear from you. I can't wait to share the cool stuff I am working on.
