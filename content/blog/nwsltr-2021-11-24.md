## Abstract and Results

This week, I've been working on "Anachro Forth", a [forth]-inspired, bytecode-compiled scripting language for Anachro Powerbus platform.

[forth]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)

The intended use case for Anachro Forth is to write and compile scripts on a Host PC, and to load and execute these scripts in a constrained, no_std environment, such as on embedded systems or WASM targets.

This language will be used to build Expansion Cards for Powerbus, which come with their own built-in drivers, written and compiled to Anachro Forth.

I have also implemented a [REPL/interactive interpreter] for running in a PC environment, as well as a [minimal embedded example] project for the Nordic nRF52840, to validate the deserialization and runtime on a physical embedded platform.

[REPL/interactive interpreter]: https://github.com/anachro-rs/anachro-forth/blob/6870ac4ce32e144fbad2f5379038eb34293b6489/host/src/main.rs
[minimal embedded example]: https://github.com/anachro-rs/anachro-forth/blob/6870ac4ce32e144fbad2f5379038eb34293b6489/emb-playground/src/bin/forth.rs

Initial development has gone smoothly, and the project is already up and running on embedded devices for testing.

The [Anachro Forth compiler/runtime] is currently capable of:

[Anachro Forth compiler/runtime]: https://crates.io/crates/anachro-forth-core

1. Compiling source code on a PC
2. Serializing the program to bytes
3. Deserializing the program on an embedded system, using no allocations
4. Initializing the no_std runtime using the deserialized data
5. Executing the program on the embedded system

The above example only required <= 4K of Flash, <= 1K of RAM, and the program itself was serialized to under 100 bytes.

**Overall: A successful initial release!**


## Background Information

Anachro Forth is planned to be part of the Anachro Powerbus Platform. Powerbus is a totally built-from scratch hardware and software system, which I plan to use for home automation, art installations, sensor networks, human machine interfaces, and lighting.

Powerbus uses Ethernet cables to provide an RS-485 data bus, as well as up to 60W of power across the network. Power is provided using off the shelf USB-C PD supplies (like those used by laptops), and each individual device is capable of using up to 10W for automation or lighting purposes. Devices are daisy-chained to reduce cabling complexity.

Anachro Forth is planned to power a variety of extension cards, such as relays for controlling mains voltage, environmental sensors, data logging, and user interfaces. This will allow for hot-swapping of accessories, without requiring firmware updates.

If you're interested in more about Powerbus, I had a chat in September with a couple of folks where we talked about some of the implementation details of Powerbus, my plans, and the first revision of hardware. Click above to watch the chat on YouTube.

I have not yet made any stable releases of Powerbus as it is still in active development, but you can view the current status [here on GitHub].

## Suggestions For Future Research

Over the next week, I plan to wrap up Anachro Forth by writing a simple demonstration hardware driver. In a [twitter poll], there was interest in building an SSD1306-based OLED driver, but I'll probably start with something simpler, like a basic time-based Relay driver.
Interested in using Anachro Forth?

I've already had a couple people express interest in using Anachro Forth in their projects or products. If you need an ultra-light-weight scripting language, let me know! I am looking for end users to give it a test drive. Just [send me an email] so I know to keep you updated.

## Interested in using Powerbus?

Are you looking to build a no-cloud smart device network? Perhaps looking to automate sensors or lighting in your own house or office?

I plan to build a limited (<= 50 devices) test batch of Beta-release Powerbus devices, and I am looking for people interested in buying, testing, or extending on top of the Powerbus platform. I currently hope to produce these before the end of the year, and shipping shortly afterwards. Just [send me an email] if you are interested!
